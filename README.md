# adal-mvc-rest-multitenant-sample1

The purpose of this quick and ugly project is to learn how to use ADAL to authenticate an MVC site against a multi-tenant O365 app to
call Office Graph REST APIs across several domains : graph, Outlook, SharePoint.

It requires the app to be set up via the Azure Portal.
